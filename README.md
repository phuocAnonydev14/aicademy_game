## Introduction

Physics-based games provide an engaging and interactive experience by simulating real-world physics. In this guide, we'll build a word game where players arrange letter blocks using physics interactions to form words. This combines the cognitive challenge of word games with the tactile satisfaction of physics manipulation.

Our game will use React for the UI and Matter.js for physics simulation. Players will drag and drop letter blocks to arrange them in the correct order to spell target words, with increasing difficulty levels.

## Theory and Concepts

### Physics Engines

Physics engines are software components that simulate physical systems. They handle:

- **Rigid body dynamics**: How solid objects move and interact
- **Collision detection**: Determining when objects intersect
- **Collision response**: Calculating how objects should react after colliding
- **Constraints**: Limiting how objects can move relative to each other

In web development, popular physics engines include:
- Matter.js (which we'll use)
- Box2D
- Planck.js
- p2.js

### Matter.js Basics

Matter.js is a 2D physics engine for the web. It provides several core modules:

- **Engine**: Updates the simulation
- **World**: Contains all bodies, constraints, etc.
- **Bodies**: Factory for creating rigid bodies
- **Body**: Methods for manipulating bodies
- **Render**: Visualizes the simulation
- **Runner**: Handles the game loop
- **Events**: Handles event subscriptions
- **Mouse**: Handles mouse interactions
- **MouseConstraint**: Allows dragging bodies with the mouse

Key concepts in Matter.js:

1. **Bodies**: Physical objects with properties like mass, position, velocity, etc.
2. **Composites**: Groups of bodies and constraints
3. **Constraints**: Connections between bodies
4. **World**: Container for all simulation objects
5. **Engine**: Updates the simulation state

### Game Design Principles

For our word physics game, we'll apply these principles:

1. **Clear objectives**: Players should understand they need to arrange letters to form words
2. **Progressive difficulty**: Start with short words and increase length and complexity
3. **Immediate feedback**: Visual and textual feedback when words are correct or incorrect
4. **Intuitive controls**: Dragging letters should feel natural and responsive
5. **Visual appeal**: Attractive design with satisfying physics interactions

## Setting Up the Project

### Prerequisites
